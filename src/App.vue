        <h2>Database of ties between UK academia and the fossil fuel industry</h2>
<p>
          This web portal shows the ongoing decentralised research by a coalition of organisations into the
          relationships between UK universities and research funding bodies, and the fossil fuel industry. The database
          shows different types of
          fossil ties per institution since the Paris Agreement (2015), such as (co-)funding of research and professors,
          sponsoring of students' studies and activities, presentations of the fossil fuel industry at career events or as
          part of the study programme, and more. The database is regularly updated while new information comes in, and we
          check all information before publishing here: only confirmed ties for which we have evidence are displayed.
        </p>
        <p>The database functions as an information source for investigative journalists, action groups, students,
          university staff and administrators, NGOs, policymakers, and the public.

        <h2>Why map the ties between academia and the fossil fuel industry?</h2>
        <p>There has been increasing social scrutiny of the close ties between universities and the fossil fuel industry.
          For an informed discussion about whether fossil fuel companies, lobby organisations or research institutes
          should be present on campus and in what capacity, we are documenting all current relationships between UK
          universities and research funding bodies, and these companies.
        </p>
        <!--
        <p>Funding from fossil companies has been shown to bias research in favour of fossil fuels, and may
          influence the direction of research towards technologies which will least disrupt fossil companies' business
          model, rather than those most necessary for an energy transition.
        </p>
        <p>The presence of such companies on campus - at careers fairs, guest lectures and sponsoring students
          organisations,
          for example - can be seen as a tacit endorsement by the university of them and their activities, and
          contributes to their 'social licence to operate', i.e. their perceived legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
        </p>
        <p>Increasingly, academics and students are demanding that their research institutions stop association with
          fossil companies. This would target a key blocker of the energy transition, namely the influence of fossil
          fuel companies on the direction of research & development, public opinion and policymakers.</p>

        <h2>About the coalition</h2>
        <p>This project involves collaboration by a <b>coalition of local and national
            organisations</b>. We support and coordinate
          decentralised research into relationships between academia and the fossil fuel industry. We do this through
          decentralised information gathering on campuses, freedom of information (FOI) requests, and crowdsourcing.</p>
