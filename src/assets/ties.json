        "description": "The Delphi Consortium was founded in the early 1980s by Guus Berkhout, who had worked with Shell for a few years after getting his PhD at TUD and is now leading a climate sceptic organisation (Clintel). Once a year, a written report is provided to the sponsors; companies from the fossil fuel industry. The Delphi team mainly consists of scientists from TUD, but there are some external projects (until 2021, i.a. with UU researchers). ",
        "extra_description": "\"Ging je in Delft mijnbouw studeren, dan werd koninklijke olie vrijwel zeker je werkgever. Een bekend voorbeeld is Guus Berkhout, die in 1970 promoveerde in de signaalverwerking, vervolgens enkele jaren bij Shell werkte en toen terugkeerde aan de universiteit. Als hoogleraar akoestiek wist hij vervolgens in de jaren tachtig en negentig het nodige geld bij Shell los te peuteren om te onderzoeken of je met geluidsgolven olievelden kon opsporen. Daarvoor richtte hij ook het Delphi Consortium op, een alliantie van oliebedrijven die zijn onderzoek ondersteunden. Berkhout is inmiddels met pensioen, maar Delphi financiert nog altijd ruim twintig promovendi en postdocs.\" \n\nDelphi Consoirtium focused on research to improve the seismic\nimaging method and it targeted sponsors from the oil & gas industry. Of course the world has changed since\nthen. In particular, over the years there has been an increasing awareness of the impact of fossil fuels on the\nenvironment. The fact that the rising concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is due to anthropogenic emission and is contributing to the global temperature increase, see the graph in Figure 1, is hardly\nquestioned anymore.\" \n\nThe Delphi team mainly consists of scientists from the departments of Applied Physics and Earth Sciences at the Delft University of Technology. Furthermore, there are some external project (Utrecht University and Cyprus Institute).\n\nWithin Delphi research is mostly conducted by Ph.D. students and Post-Docs, supervised by staff members. \nWithin Delphi around 10 Ph.D. students and 5 Post-docs are active, often strengthened by guest-researchers from abroad.",

        "extra_description": "\"The Utrecht Earth Sciences Association (UAV) has sponsorship agreements with EBN, Shell, Petrogas and Wintershall. In exchange for a financial contribution, the association offers those companies company presentations, visits and advertisements. From those contributions, the board can in turn organise activities. Without that 'fossil' income, some of the study activities would become too expensive and they could do less. Besides, fossil companies have traditionally always provided good job opportunities for UAV members. The sponsorship arrangements put members in easy contact with companies where they could later come to work. Moreover, many alumni work at those companies, which makes for strong ties. The association is also sponsored by over 30 companies that are not from the fossil industry. \n\nAccording to Dexter, despite its ties to the fossil industry, UAV is sympathetic to the energy transition. \"The lunches we organise are always vegetarian and we as an association always prefer the bike, bus, boat or train to the plane. We try to print fewer programme booklets by offering them online. And every year we organise the 'energy transition challenge'. This is a six-afternoon activity where our members learn more about their role in the energy transition and what it involves. So we are always looking for things that can be improved.\"\n\nThe board therefore held a member consultation on 16 February on the association's links with the fossil industry. By doing so, the board wanted to examine whether it is still desirable to maintain those ties. Within the association, there has been occasional discussion on the subject for some time. UAV's board wants to set up a new sponsorship policy and the member participation was mainly about the frameworks for new sponsorship agreements and whether sustainability should be part of it.\n\nThose present shared a variety of opinions. Some felt that all ties with the fossil industry should be severed, while others felt that UAV members going into the fossil industry could make a difference from within with their knowledge. The board needs to make a thorough assessment in the coming weeks before they can make a decision. They hope to have a policy ready for academic year 2023-2024.\"",

Shell and Petrobras are executive members of the firm\u2019s communication network. Van Riel founded a peer-reviewed journal in 1997, which has received financial support from Shell.",
        "extra_description": "\"The Utrecht Earth Sciences Association (UAV) has sponsorship agreements with EBN, Shell, Petrogas and Wintershall. In exchange for a financial contribution, the association offers those companies company presentations, visits and advertisements. From those contributions, the board can in turn organise activities. Without that 'fossil' income, some of the study activities would become too expensive and they could do less. Besides, fossil companies have traditionally always provided good job opportunities for UAV members. The sponsorship arrangements put members in easy contact with companies where they could later come to work. Moreover, many alumni work at those companies, which makes for strong ties. The association is also sponsored by over 30 companies that are not from the fossil industry. \n\nAccording to Dexter, despite its ties to the fossil industry, UAV is sympathetic to the energy transition. \"The lunches we organise are always vegetarian and we as an association always prefer the bike, bus, boat or train to the plane. We try to print fewer programme booklets by offering them online. And every year we organise the 'energy transition challenge'. This is a six-afternoon activity where our members learn more about their role in the energy transition and what it involves. So we are always looking for things that can be improved.\"\n\nThe board therefore held a member consultation on 16 February on the association's links with the fossil industry. By doing so, the board wanted to examine whether it is still desirable to maintain those ties. Within the association, there has been occasional discussion on the subject for some time. UAV's board wants to set up a new sponsorship policy and the member participation was mainly about the frameworks for new sponsorship agreements and whether sustainability should be part of it.\n\nThose present shared a variety of opinions. Some felt that all ties with the fossil industry should be severed, while others felt that UAV members going into the fossil industry could make a difference from within with their knowledge. The board needs to make a thorough assessment in the coming weeks before they can make a decision. They hope to have a policy ready for academic year 2023-2024.\"",
